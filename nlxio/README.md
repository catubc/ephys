Python module to read data from Neuralynx electro-physiology recording equipment

Supports reading from following filetypes:
*  .ncs continous sample files
*  .ntt tetrode spike files
*  .nev event files

These are all the filetypes I've needed to use, which is why they are all
that is implemented. If you need something else feel free to implement it
and I'll pull the update.

A description of the Neuralynx file formats is available on [their website](http://neuralynx.com/research_software/development_software/).
